      "gonzales has said he was satisfied that rove \"took care to avoid\" any impropriety in meeting in march with intel corp. executives, and in participating in broad discussions about administration energy policy while owning more than $100,000 worth of intel corp. stock and more than $200,000 worth of stock in enron corp., general electric co. and other energy companies. on june 7, rove sold more than $1 million in stock in companies doing business with the government. \n",
      "waxman, ranking democrat on the house government reform committee, said federal law requires executive branch departments and agencies, including the white house, to report \"any information, allegation or complaint\" involving potential criminal conduct by an employee to the justice department. he said he was not aware of any reason rove should be exempt from such outside investigation. \n",

      "how come ford adopts the same white-collar performance review system as general electric but gets vilified for it, hounded by discrimination lawyers and aarp? last week, less than a year after launching it, ceo jacques nasser was moved to dump a brand new executive grading system designed to weed out the least capable 10% of ford's managers. \n",
      "the short answer is that ford isn't ge, though jack welch has been a model for what mr. nasser seeks to accomplish at the auto company.\n",
      "bringing such a torquemada system into a firm that faces slowing sales and whose own boss considers his colleagues notoriously flabby and easy on themselves meant it was a downsizing scheme from the start, whether advertised that way or not. ge didn't introduce its version until a decade after the neutron jack phase. but never mind. trumpeting a win last week, aarp declared its victory goes way beyond ford. it sure does. \n",
      "forced ranking has waxed and waned as a fad over the decades, and most students of management hold their noses around it. its resurgence, at a time when many employers are contemplating their first layoffs in years, can only mean that companies are nervous about preserving their freedom to hire and fire in a world run increasingly by the job-discrimination bar. \n",
      "ask any non-deluded european. what makes the u.s. economy relatively nimble is that companies are not afraid to take on workers because they know they can always get rid of them later. harsh as this sounds, it's why we have a lush job market compared to the employment saharas of the old world. \n",
      "yet firing in america has been a work in progress. half a decade ago, enlightened companies tried employee buyouts, but the lawyers descended, forcing companies to offer the buyouts indiscriminately. result: highly marketable workers took the windfall and immediately found other jobs, while people who considered themselves unemployable skipped the loot and clung to their cubicles. \n",
      "other companies, on the theory that it was ok to tell people they had to go because their functions or departments were being discontinued, bravely downsized the old-fashioned way. but this was no proof against lawsuits. remember texaco, coca-cola and others where the very existence of affirmative-action programs became fodder for litigation by both minorities and older white employees? \n",
      "searching for a way out of the legal maze, ford tried two years ago to combine forced ranking with buyouts, aiming offers exclusively at low-ranked employees. result: grumbling in the hallways of \"rewarding failure\" and good employees angling for low grades so they could become eligible for a golden parachute. finally, starting this year, ford opted for an out-and-out forced ranking system, which would have given 10% of white-collar employees annually a \"c\" grade that meant either shape up or you're gone next year. \n",
      "microsoft, lucent, conoco, enron and eds all have used forced ranking to maintain or improve the quality of their work forces. while many find the idea distasteful or complain it substitutes a yearly spasm for what should be a continuous process, at least it solves a real problem. survey after survey finds that even the happiest worker-bees gripe about their employer's reluctance to get strict with poor performers. a recent mckinsey poll of managers at big companies found that only 16% said their employer could even recognize the difference between stars and slackers. \n",
      "but ford was already in the soup over the explorer/firestone fiasco. it didn't stand a chance when the detroit papers opened a new front over its a-b-c grading system for 18,000 managers. accentuating the coverage was a simmering quest to discover any sort of rift between mr. nasser and his chairman, bill ford, great-grandson of the founder. \n",
      "mr. ford has somehow been anointed keeper of the company's conscience because of blood chemistry or something. inevitably, he wants to be liked and wants the company to be liked. putting a ford in the chairmanship was probably the worst thing the company could have done at a time when mr. nasser was clearly set on giving the place a kick in the pants. \n",
      "in the ranking controversy, mr. ford soon was reported to be \"concerned about the system's impact on morale.\" notice how this differs from \"the system is an urgent necessity so ford can become a better company.\" with this kind of support, management quickly wilted in the face of pressure from the old-folks lobby (which has appointed itself guardian of anybody over 45) and other victim contingents. \n",
      "mr. nasser didn't help himself by appearing in a ford diversity video haranguing an audience for containing \"too many white faces\" or by installing rewards for executives who meet minority hiring goals. presto, lawsuits galore. the ones ford will have the most trouble with are those filed by white males claiming they were victims of age discrimination in order to make way for blacks and women. \n",
      "one of the ironies, as ford shows, is that companies these days have reasons of their own for recruiting minorities and women. were the supposedly archaic, 19th-century principle of freedom of contract still in effect  i.e., employers are free to hire and fire at will  there would be a lot more affirmative action, a lot more honestly pursued. \n",
      "ge may not exactly be the rainbow coalition, but it does have a lesson for ford. under its version of forced rankings, 10% of managers are assigned to a bottom grade each year, which means they're cut off from the rich booty ge awards the top 20% and the job security of the workaday 70%. if low-ranked managers don't improve, they are asked to move on. \n",
      "a big difference, though, is that the process is not concentrated in a single, highly neuroticized annual ritual. ge carries on with much year-round mentoring and bellowing and measuring, so nobody has cause to be surprised by the score he gets. in fact, anyone who went to work there in the past 15 years would have known exactly what he was getting into. \n",
      "here's the lesson: nobody doubts that ge's hiring and firing, whatever the color or gender of the fodder, is all about business. it takes time to build a reputation for heartlessly focusing on the bottom line, but once you do, it can be liberating.\n",

      "(c) reuters limited 2001.\n",
      "\n",
      "moscow, july 17 (reuters) - russia's tyumen oil company said on wednesday it planned huge expansion of its upstream and downstream profile through ventures with foreign oil majors. company president simon kukes told reuters in an interview that tyumen - russia's fourth-largest oil producer with output of 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) - would also seek a new york stock exchange listing in 2002 after market conditions improved. \n",
      "\"we aim to be a multi-national company and the first step is in ukraine, where we will within a year be the number one retailer of oil products,\" he said.\n",
      "kukes said tyumen was also interested in eastern europe and in talks on projects that a included a stake in lithuania's mazeikiu refinery , but he declined to elaborate. \n",
      "\"eastern europe has logistical advantages for russian firms. we can bring in oil easily and get a significant market share. i also see a role for us in china, india and the middle east.\" he said tyumen, controlled by russia's alfa conglomerate, saw foreign oil majors' involvement as a key to its growth. \n",
      "\"we would welcome a strategic partner to take a stake in the firm and, in fact, we are now in talks with several foreign partners, including texaco ,\" kukes said. \n",
      "he added earlier talks with phillips had had no result. \n",
      "tyumen is involved in the $11 billion kovykta project with bp and several russian firms to produce and ship gas to china, as well as in transneft's adria pipeline project to link outlets for russian crude in north and south europe. \n",
      "in august tyumen will take a key downstream step. \n",
      "with texaco in moscow it will open russia's first star mart convenience store in a partnership expanding its 800-strong filling network by combining them with the u.s. star mart brand. \n",
      "earlier this year the firms inked a deal to jointly produce lubricants at tyumen's linos refinery in ukraine. kukes said total investments in 2001 are planned at $800 million, with another $1 billion earmarked for each of the coming years. \n",
      "tyumen also got a boost by being rated the world's best oil company in 2000 by financial times energy for \"phenomenal growth in the past year, breaking into the world's top 15 oil firms.\" \n",
      "\"by year end, we could jump from fourth to third place among russian oil producers,\" said the u.s.-educated kukes, who is part of tyumen's efforts to boost its profile internationally. \n",
      "vertically integrated \n",
      "tyumen is now eyeing natural gas, angling to up its kovykta stake and in rospan, with 600 billion cubic metres in reserves. \n",
      "kukes sees gas as part of a strategy to develop tyumen on the lines of enron - producing crude, gas and power. \n",
      "\"gas is an essential component of a vertically-integrated oil company and in the way we see ourselves in future,\" kukes said. \"we aim that in five years, 10-15 percent of our revenues will come from gas and condensate.\" \n",
      "but aggressive expansion has brought tyumen into conflict with competitors. it has locked horns with arch-rival interros to wrest control over a stake in kovykta, and its role in oil firm sidanco - where bp owns 10 percent - has been criticised. \n",
      "\"we'd like to get at least 25 percent in kovykta,\" kukes said, noting tyumen was keen for bp, which has a 31 percent stake, to remain project leader. \n",
      "tyumen also angered influential gas trader itera by trying to obtain control over its bankrupt gas producer, rospan. \n",
      "\"rospan is a profitable firm but for some reason was losing money,\" kukes said, adding tyumen would turn the company around.\n",

      "we could send our heating bill to the navy as dick cheney has. who knows, maybe we could fuel up our cars and let the energy department pay the bill.\n",

      "my, how the scene has changed. in mid-may president bush unveiled a cheney-authored energy plan that promoted drilling and nuking and mining but overlooked conserving. that's when the vice president dismissed conservation as a \"personal virtue\" but no energy policy. \n",
      "the 170-page bush policy did speak ominously of a growing \"energy crisis.\" \n",

      "smearing pakistan and it current military president with islamic fundamentalism is disingenuous, since the nation is practically secular when compared to its neighbors in iran and afghanistan. indeed the deposed president's paeans to fundamentalism in response to domestic problems were one impetus for the military takeover in the first place. \n",

      "\n",
      "to highlight the need for this reconciliation, i will summarize the discussions from the meeting this morning.  no exceptions were reported.   however, var for ees changed materially from the day before causing the market risk group to question the results.  it was determined that ees enpower feeds into risktrac  were counted twice (for either west or east) for the calculation of var.  also it was reported, as a result of book name changes last evening, a book (one book,  two different names) was sent to infinity twice. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "i can also conduct surveys and provide enron with technical and fruitful\n",
      "information and policy recommendations. i've done a job like that recently,\n",
      "on the oil-pipeline project in chad and cameroon. as you may already know,\n",
      "this is a $4 billion project recently launched, with the support of the\n",
      "world bank, and led by three major energy firms: exxon and chevron of the\n",
      "usa, and petronas of malaysia. i wrote a detailed and long report, which\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2.- being fully employed by enron.\n",
      "\n",
      "in this respect, i would prefer to work as a researcher for either enron\n",
      "project development and management or capital and risk management\n",
      "departments. in these fields, i've also innovated. i've created among\n",
      "concepts, tools and processes. for instance, the \"sensible guide for\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3.- the business of businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "dear dr lay, if you accept this third proposal, it will probably be the best\n",
      "investment enron has ever made. i'm an independent researcher and\n",
      "entrepreneur, with a strong quantitative analysis competence, and a\n",

      "and also in business and economics (institut d'etudes politiques of paris).\n",
      "\n",
      "in this third proposal i'm bringing to enron two key inventions i've made,\n",
      "two types of financial products targeting consumers and companies. i believe\n",
      "they will interest enron.\n",
      "\n",
      "these products have a market potential worldwide, unlimited. they will\n",
      "create an entirely new industry: the business of businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "i'm currently looking for investors with whom i can launch those products.\n",
      "we will be the world leader here, and remain in that position for a long\n",
      "time before copycats try to reach us. i've created the products, and nobody\n",
      "knows about them or about their extraordinary markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "i started to talk to you about these products when we met, but you were\n",
      "hurrying, and the many solicitations and noises of the forum made it\n",
      "difficult to explain my point. i'm writing you as you asked me, because\n",
      "firstly i believe these products will interest enron. secondly i know how\n",
      "these products will boost three types of enron services: online marketplace;\n",
      "broadband services; and energy & commodities. plus, these products, and the\n",
      "business of businesses they create are an excellent placement for enron.\n",
      "\n",
      "among the many reasons why i believe my products will interest enron are\n",
      "these:\n",
      "\n",
      "(i) their market is global.\n",
      "(ii) they are directly related to consumption and savings.\n",
      "(iii) they're excellent saving vehicles, for instance for pension or life\n",
      "insurance.\n",
      "(iv) they concern payment transactions and transmissions (and thanks to\n",
      "information technology, costs here decrease while productivity will grow).\n",
      "(v) they are both offline and online business (these products will be\n",
      "excellent for enron e-business).\n",
      "(vi) i want to be and remain a global leader.\n",
      "(vii) the products' growth potential is borderless\n",
      "(viii) there's no competitor and before copycats arrive we would have\n",
      "strongly imposed ourselves as the leader and the reference, increasing\n",
      "chances that customers remain faithful to us.\n",
      "(ix) my products will allow enron to beat its competitors.\n",
      "(x) enron will earn a lot of revenues, many new clients, and very big and\n",
      "unprecedented profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "i'm looking for investors willing to put around $7 million. given that the\n",
      "revenues generated can very rapidly reach the range of $500 million to $1\n",
      "billion, that initial $7 million is a wise and very profitable investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "if you're interested, i'm ready to present the products and its business\n",
      "scenario to you. the business model is very innovative, unprecedented.\n",
      "\n",

      "japan, today and for the coming decade. particularly for the financial\n",
      "products i'm proposing.\n",
      "\n",
      "these financial products i want enron to launch with me in japan, perfectly\n",
      "fit japanese consumption manners, their problematic pension system, and life\n",
      "insurance structure there.\n",
      "\n",
      "public pension systems are under pressure every where, particularly in\n",
      "japan. in germany they are trying to reform it. but there's no consensus in\n",
      "the governments (federal and states') or in the parliaments (federal and\n",
      "states'). last week, chancellor gerhard schr?der won some parliamentary\n",
      "approval. but the package he proposed is far from solving the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "in the meantime, problems may accumulate, the situation could worsen. what\n",
      "seems sure is that in a foreseeable future, governments, not only in germany\n",
      "but in all developed and ageing countries, will no longer be able to pay\n",
      "pensions at the level they have promised or are continuing to promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "an additional bad news, even company pensions will suffer. in today's\n",

      "\n",
      "it should be noted that bc's premier, gordon campbell, has had long-standing poor relations with alcan, inc. of canada, a competitor of alcoa's.  while in the opposition, campbell helped to scuttle a completion deal that would have allowed alcan to finish a $1.3b hydroelectric power project.  earlier this year, bc hydro considered a plan to refund alcan some money for an energy buy-back deal similar to the load reduction agreements south of the border.  if campbell can move to secure an aluminum partner he does not have a problem with, he will likely do so - to that end, look for alcoa and bc hydro talks to be productive if the premier has anything to say about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "alcoa is still in talks with bpa on potential continued load reduction agreements.  in a recent shareholder meeting last week, alcoa's management was peppered with questions from wall street fund managers regarding the bpa talks - the feeling in the sector is that aluminum prices have begun to bottom out, and the impetus is now to start rebuilding production in the pacific northwest and re-establishing revenue growth.\n",

      "campbell's government will be moving swiftly on the heels of the house bill to approve anwr drilling to fast track the lifting of the moratorium on offshore oil and natural gas exploration.  some of the communities in northern british columbia, such as fort. st. john, dawson creek, black gold and fort mcmurray, have had significant recent population booms, and they are poised to hit critical mass as oil company money rolls into the region.  currently there is debate about how to structure and site the pipeline that will run from anwr through british columbia.   significant oil company exploration royalties will flow into local tax base coffers, which will make the offshore drilling an extremely competitive business between bc and alaska.\n",
      "\n",
      "bc hydro\n",
      "hydro officials are in the process of officially courting new partners and are becoming more aggressive in their attempts to find energy buyers.  due to its ability to generate cheap hydroelectric power, bc hydro is looking to be competitive player in the market - avoiding its traditional subsidy of the \"jobs for power\" program, and pursuing lucrative cross-border contracts with us firms.  at the same time, hydro will be moving to slice community programs (anywhere from $6 to $8 million) and outsourcing its information technology departments for savings in the $20-$25 million range.  bc hydro, whose annual revenues hover typically around $300 million, is looking at early mini-budget estimates for 2001 to be in the $375 million range.  its trading subsidiary, powerex, has not come back with a refund counteroffer to california, and it looks like ca will have to take this issue to court.\n",
      "bc hydro is in the process of selecting its new chair of the board, which is looking more and more likely to be larry bell, from campbell's transition team.  we have yet to pin down the name of the second candidate, although we believe he is a vice-president at west coast energy.  the selection will not likely occur for another two weeks, so we do not anticipate any major policy shifts until late october or november.  in the meantime, campbell and gary collins (the finance minister) will be calling the shots on hydro's future.  keep in mind that the minister of energy and mines, neufeld, has the official title, but his power has been greatly curbed by the premier - the administration will be playing it safe until they feel they have a few knowledgeable players on board who are receptive to their agenda.\n",

      "financial solvency\n",
      "after having a chance to speak with a source close to sen. patty murray's (d-wa) office, it has become apparent that the energy and water appropriations bill to provide bpa an additional $2 billion in borrowing authority (over the $3.75 billion of existing authority it already has) may be scuttled.  sen. murray has been fighting a provision in that bill which would have forced bpa to come back to the senate every year for review - the white house, the senate appropriations committee, omb and the budget committee have all been opposed to the entire bill.  the feeling is that if the $2 billion of additional authority would be issued, the money would be coming off the back of social security and medicare.\n",
      "\n",
      "eight northwest senators will be convening on this issue over the course of the next month and a half.  the next time this issue will come up again is the middle of september, when there is another energy bill conference.  obviously, now that bush's energy bill has passed the house, they will be looking to bring considerable pressure on democratic senators to pass the legislation - we would not be surprised if a deal to extend bpa borrowing authority is linked with support for anwr drilling.\n",

      "fish managers, notably critfc's bob heinith and odfw's christine mallette, had stumped hard for any spill at all being better than none, but they lacked survival data to show that it would benefit fish in this extremely low flow year. power operators and the corps of engineers questioned the models used to determine the value of the spill, citing the impact of adverse tailwater conditions from low flows being compounded by spilling water, making it extra hard for juvenile fish to leave the area below the dams, and hence suffer higher mortality from predators like the northern pike-minnow.\n",

      "dam breaching\n",

      "\n",
      "\"the bush administration has so far failed to allocate funds to implement the 2000 salmon recovery plan to avoid dam removal,\" mcdermott said in a july 19 press release. \"if this bill nudges them to take the plan seriously, and it is successful in preventing the breaching of the dams, then no one would be happier than i would,\" he said. \"now is the time to plan for all contingencies.\" \n",

      "pacific northwest utilities and energy interests have battled long and hard with salmon environmentalists over the issue with dam breaching.  the environmentalists took their lumps earlier this year when energy prices shot up and left them nowhere to run politically.  now that energy prices have come down again, they will continue to beat their drum over salmon preservation - although they are much weakened now.\n",

      "\n",
      "we requested that missing data (e.g., phone line down) be backfilled in a later day's file, but this is not possible because the process to produce this file only queries on meter data for a specific date, not all data received on a specific date. for example, if they ran it today, for 7 august, we would receive all meter data for that date, but they would have actually received more than that on the 7th, perhaps data dated 6 aug for meters that failed to dial in on that day. getting this data will require further development (read: mo' money).\n",

      "also, the file is 26mb, of which more that 25% is blank spaces on the end of each line. again, since this is an external application, i have been told that it is not possible to eliminate this extra space. (not a killer, since we won't actually be putting it in the database, but it just adds to processing/network overhead.)\n",

      "i met with andy dearman and bill newman of southern on friday.  they talked about what is going on with the non-jurisdictional utilities that have signed a mou to develop a rto.  the group has met a couple of times to discuss the process they will use.  confidentiality agreements have been signed, so no details are available, but they have agreed to a voting structure for the development.  southern has about one third of the votes (and 65%of the assets) and it takes at least two other parties agreeing with southern to carry a vote.  southern says they spent a lot of time convincing the other parties that southern was not going to run, or dominate, the process.  after that, southern said the group started to pull together and get organized for the development.  \n",
      "\n",
      "they said everyone in the group appeared to be ready to find ways to make the rto work and resolve the hurdles the non-jurisdictional utilities have been expressing with the development of other rtos.  they said there were some rough spots that had to be resolved and they couldn't be sure agreement would be reached, but at this point there was a lot of cooperation. \n",
      "\n",
      "andy and bill wanted to convince me that this was not a delaying tactic by southern and they were doing everything possible to ensure that a complete rto filing could be ready by 12/15/01.  they also said they thought this is what ed holland wanted to discuss with steve kean.  \n",
      "\n",
      "we talked about how other stakeholders could have input to the development.  they said that it was too early to make any commitment, but the group had started thinking about it and they expected an input process to be available by late summer. \n",
      "they said southern was in favor of some process that would provide stakeholders the opportunity to look at what was being considered and advise the development group as early as possible.  they said they understood the difficulty stakeholders had with the approach southern used in its initial filing and wanted to do it different, but they pointed out again that southern could not dictate the process that would be allowed by the group.  in the meantime, they said if we wanted to provide position papers on any part of the rto development they would make sure the papers were circulated in the group or we could continue to hold bilateral discussions with them or other members of the development group.\n",
      "\n",
      "jim, i still think it would be worthwhile to have a meeting between ed and steve kean, and i would include you and invite andy and bill to come.  i don't think they want to discuss anything technical at this point; they just want to convince enron that the approach southern is taking provides the quickest development of a rto for the southern area, and they want any help we can give in convincing ferc to let this process run.  \n",
      "\n",
      "i also think we need to pass on filing a response to southern's may 15th status report, either alone or with alabama municipal electric authority ( donna, i guess that's who you meant in the memo below, since aec has signed a mou with southern?).  i will get in touch with bob reilley to find out why we haven't heard from epsa on its filing.  i still think that's the best approach.\n",

      "\n",
      "also we had talked  about possible comments on the may 15 southern filing; coral was working on comments through epsa.  nothing has been filed by epsa yet.  \n",
      "\n",
      "alabama did file comments on the may 15 status report and they have asked that the ferc establish a technical conference to \"publicly air and evaluate the alleged governance concerns and the concerns regarding significant delay...\"  following a technical conference, they ask for a judge to convene a settlement conference at ferc to \"undertake a properly supervised and serious development of an rto for the se without further wasted time.\"\n",

      "a new staff report issued today by the federal trade commission examines which features of various state retail electricity programs appear to have resulted in consumer benefits and which have not. the staff report also highlights certain jurisdictional limitations on the states' authority to design successful retail competition plans and discusses whether there is a need for federal legislative or regulatory action in this regard. the report, \"competition and consumer protection perspectives on electric power regulatory reform: focus on retail competition,\" updates a july 2000 ftc staff report and responds to a request to update that report made by the chairman of the energy and commerce committee of the united states house of representatives, w. j. \"billy\" tauzin, and the chairman of the subcommittee on energy and air quality, joe barton.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "given that states are in a transition phase that represents a hybrid of\n",
      "regulation and competition, many of the expected benefits of competition have not yet emerged.  nothing that has happened so far, however, indicates that competition  once the transition period is completed  will not produce additional benefits to electricity customers. competition\n",

      "generation investments and for suppliers to offer innovative services\n",
      "and products to consumers.\n",
      "\n",
      "among the main conclusions of the report and the reasoning underlying\n",
      "these conclusions are the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "competitive wholesale markets are important to achieving effective competition in retail markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "for all of the expected benefits of retail competition to be realized, it\n",
      "is imperative that wholesale markets be competitive. effective\n",
      "wholesale and retail competition will mutually reinforce each other,\n",
      "thus combining to bring benefits to retail customers. and as\n",
      "wholesale and retail markets become regional, governing policies and\n",
      "jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and retail competition to be successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "policies are needed in retail and wholesale markets that will increase demand-side responsiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "so far, neither retail nor wholesale markets for electricity generation\n",
      "encourage effective demand-side responses. generally, retail\n",

      "buyers respond by reducing their consumption by a significant\n",

      "encourage the development of innovative new services (e.g., real-time\n",
      "pricing).\n",
      "\n",
      "policies that set the price of standard offer service for non-choosing customers have a substantial effect on the entry of new retail suppliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "effective retail competition, and the subsequent consumer benefits of\n",
      "retail competition, are much more likely with actual entry. state policies that eliminate barriers to entry to allow for the long-run, efficient entry of entities to compete with the incumbent will assist the development of retail electricity markets.\n",

      "in efforts to minimize the number of times each user will change their number, we will be converting all stentofon addresses in eb1 that are scheduled to move into esc this year to a 5000 series number.    (i.e.  if your stento number was 364, then your new number will be 5364.)  we will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme.  please instruct the users within your group of this change.\n",
